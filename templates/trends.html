            <p class="para">The year 2021 is here, and now is the best time to observe the front end development trends that are
                unfolding. In this article, we are going to overview the most popular JavaScript frameworks of 2021. If
                you do not adapt to change, you are bound to get buried by the competitors who do.</p>
            <p class="para">Unlike any other industry, trends in front end development can change faster than we can keep up with.
                This year is a very promising one when it comes to the most popular front end technologies and the
                trends that await us. Let’s take a look at our short guide on the 2021 frontend development trends and

                    <h3 class="heading">#1. The popularity of JavaScript is still increasing</h3>
            <p class="para">Let’s start with the elephant in the room. Of course, it’s not surprising, JavaScript still is one of the
                most widely used programming languages today. It offers the largest range of libraries and frameworks.
                It seems that every developer can find exactly what he or she is looking for there. React and Angular Js
                frameworks are the most popular from the list.

            <p class="para">Static websites are one of the new front end technologies. In a nutshell, static websites are those that do
                not require any databases for preserving data. It means that a frontend developer does not need a backend
                developer to create a static website. Why are we witnessing such a comeback? The answer is pretty basic:
                static websites are cheaper to develop, they are safer, and they are a lot faster than dy

            <h3 class="heading">#3. AI-based chatbot enhance customer experience</h3>
            <p class="para">AI-powered chatbots have become the ultimate answer to many questions in customer experience. They make
                customer interaction with a company more “human” and help set long-term relationships between them. With the
                advent of artificial intelligence, chatbots have become even more convenient and “smarter.” </p>
                <p class="para">They recognize human speech and provide even more logical answers. Some of them can even hold a conversation
                    like a real human and tell jokes to the user. Therefore, AI-based chatbots are worth being listed as one of
                    the top front end 2021 trends.

            <h3 class="heading">#4. Progressive web apps are gaining momentum</h3>
        <p class="para">According to recent studies, people spend a minimum of 1-3 hours using their mobile devices daily. Attempting
            to meet the modern user’s needs, companies start creating web apps that provide excellent mobile experiences
            for their visitors.</p>
            <p class="para">Progressive web apps (a.k.a. PWAs) are web applications that are indistinguishable from native apps, to the
                users. Their main advantages are that PWAs are fast (the main part of the data is stored in the cache), they
            load in a matter of mere seconds, and they do not need an Internet connection to operate properly (they can
            work offline).

            <h3 class="heading">#5. Single-page websites are trendy today</h3>
            <p class="para">One-pagers are nothing new to the world of web development; however, their advantages are the reason
                single-page websites appear on the list of frontend trends 2021 has to offer us.
            </p>
            <p class="para">First of all, single-pagers are obviously faster and cheaper to develop. This one is pretty obvious.
                Secondly, they are not over complicated with navigation and tons of content to search through. Users can
                find all the information that interests them by scrolling through the page, simple as that. Thirdly, such
                websites are more mobile-friendly than traditional ones. Remember the statistics on smartphone daily usage,
                above?
                Of course, one-pagers are not a one-size-fits-all solution. Yet, because simplifying everything we do seems
                to be the main trend today, they are guaranteed to stick around and gain even more popularity in 2021.

            <h3 class="heading">#6. Animation in a user interface design</h3>
            <p class="para">Minimalist designs are great and always in a trend. However, modern users are already tired of them. On the
            contrary, animation can make website design even more memorable and exciting. Moreover, it also helps
            improve the overall user experience and website usability.
        </p>
        <p class="para">For instance, developers can add motions to transitions between different pages or charts. The key thing they
            should remember to do is to keep the balance between “not enough” and “too much” animation. The main reason
            for animation’s increasing popularity is that this tool allows developers to add animations without having
            to possess strong knowledge of JavaScript or jQuery

            <h3 class="heading">#7. Simplicity</h3>
            <p class="para">Although we love fantastic animations and bold UI designs, we still prefer websites that are easy-to-use and…
                simple. Thus, simplicity is the next frontend trend that is worth considering. No matter what kind of
                product you create, try to keep it simple and intuitive.

            <p class="para">Cloud computing has become especially important today when almost the entire world works remotely, from
            homes. Data saved on clouds are easily accessible for teams and other project stakeholders, no matter where
            they are located. According to Gartner, the public cloud services are anticipated to increase up to $306.9
            billion this year, compared to $242.7 billion in 2019.

            <h3 class="heading">#9. No SQL databases</h3>
            <p class="para">Another important trend gaining momentum in 2021 is no SQL databases. Before considering them, let’s take a
            look at the context of their appearance.
        </p>
        <p class="para">SQL databases are relational databases built in the ’70s to decrease duplicate storage. However, they had
            some disadvantages, such as a very complicated structure, making them an expensive solution to scale them
            vertically.
        </p>
        <p class="para">That’s why developers created no SQL databases far back in the ‘2000s as a solution that is oriented at
            scaling, speedy queries, and frequent modifications in and out of the database. </p>
        </div>

            <h3 class="heading">#10. Chatbots and AI</h3>
        <p class="para">We have been caring about customer service before. However, the Coronavirus recession has made us rethink its
            importance once again. Many companies have started incorporating artificial intelligence into their customer
            support to provide even more comprehensive service to buyers, reduce anxiety, and increase their
            satisfaction.
        </p>
        <p class="para">In particular, big companies dealing with big data have realized that relying only on “human” customer
            service is inefficient when the platform serves a vast number of users. AI-driven chatbots have become the
            intelligent solution powering large brands worldwide.
        </p>
    </div>
    </div>
</div>
    <h1 class="heading">The Bottom Line: What Is The Future Of Front End Development Going To Look Like?</h1>
    <p class="para">We have an opportunity to observe one key trend that is here to stay: simplicity. We have also considered the
        best front end technologies 2021 that fit into this trend, such as Vue.js and Gatsby, are definitely going to
        take advantage of it to gain popularity; however, this in no way means that the frameworks backed by Google or
        Facebook are bound to disappear. It just means that they also have to adapt in order to not lose the battle
        against new easy-to-use frameworks, as Next.js has shown us.
    </p>
    <p class="para">There is, of course, one thing to keep in mind: there is not one only of the top front end frameworks 2021 has or
        will bring us. Any framework has its pros and cons, and it is up to you to choose the one that suits the needs
        of your project the best.
